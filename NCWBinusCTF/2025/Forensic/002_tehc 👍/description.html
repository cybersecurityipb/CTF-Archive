My wifi stopped working, so I contacted MacroHard Support for help and they sent a technician. He keeps saying he's "the greatest technician that's ever lived", but the problem is still not fixed. In fact, he caused extra problems for me after his "support". Is he even a real tech support?? What the hell did he do to my pc 😡
