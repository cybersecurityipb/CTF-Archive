⚠️ WARNING ⚠️<br>
cryptographic goo has leaked into the mainframe  
絶対に意味わからんってマジで  
absolutely no clue what's going on  
bro we opened the server logs and got jumpscared by raw hex 💀  
旗がAESスライム化されたんだが??🧪🔒  
clean this mess pls 😭 助けて～～  

────────────────────────────────<br>
context (for the brave):  
• each entry originally looked like:<br>
  `log-####: event stream entry #i`  
• but the archive only preserved:<br>
  `Record <tag> [ sha256(msg), r, s ]`  
  (whatever “tag” is, the dev was mentally on airplane mode)

also:  
• encryption gremlin decided the final flag should be stored as:<br>
  AES-ECB( SHA256(d), flag )  
  idk man 💀 blame the intern  
• dev note left behind simply reads:<br>
  “67 is lucky, keep it.”
