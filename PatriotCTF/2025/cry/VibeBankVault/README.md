## Description
X-Corp hired a new intern named Kevin. He cheated in the interview using an AI overlay during a Zoom call. His first task was to build the company’s most secure five-layer bank vault. We were amazed when he finished it before he even finished his coffee. He proudly claimed it was “unhackable” because he used a custom hashing algorithm. Later, we found out he had vibe-coded the whole thing.
